= QAvalidator Maven Plugin

This project is the Maven Plugin for _QAvalidator_.

== Usage

This is how to include the Maven Plugin into your build.

[source,xml]
-----
    <properties>
        <qav.version>1.2.1</qav.version>
    </properties>

    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>de.qaware.qav</groupId>
                <artifactId>qav-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>${qav.version}</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>qav</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                    <!-- use this in multi-module builds to avoid that
                         QAvalidator is being executed for each sub-project -->
                    <inherited>false</inherited>
                </executions>
                <configuration>
                    <analysisFilename>qa/analysis.groovy</analysisFilename>
                    <failOnError>false</failOnError>
                    <useDefaultInputDirs>true</useDefaultInputDirs>
                    <outputDir>target/qav-report</outputDir>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
-----

The configuration options in the above example are the default values. So if these values match the project's
settings, they can be skipped.

=== Default Behaviour

Input scope::
By default, this plugin includes the classes dirs of the project where the plugin is defined, and of all subprojects,
into consideration. I.e. the analysis definition does not need to contain any `inputJava` statements.
If you want to define the input scope in the analysis DSL file, using the `inputJava`, then set `useDefaultInputDirs` to `false`.

Analysis::
* By default, this plugin executes the analysis defined in the `analysisFilename` parameter.
* If that option is not defined, it uses the default file `qa/analysis.groovy`.
* If that doesn't exist, `QAvalidator` performs a cycle check on package level.

Output directory::
By default, the output directory is `target/qav-report` (to be precise: It's `${project.build.directory}/qav-report`).
To change it, set the configuration option `outputDir` as shown above.

WARNING: From within a Maven build, the outputDir will _always_ be set via the Maven plugin
(by default or explicitly), and any setting of the output directory in the analysis file will be ignored.

== Build

It is built with Maven, i.e. it's not part of the Gradle build.


== Release Notes


=== 1.0.1

Breaking Changes:

* Configuration of input directories and output directories is now completely separated.
  ** `useDefaultDirs` is now `useDefaultInputDirs`. It does not affect the output dirs any longer.


=== 1.0.0

Released.

=== 0.9.*

Trial versions.
