= QAvalidator Documentation Generator

This project contains:

* Documentation annotations for QAvalidator
* An annotation processor which generates AsciiDoc documentation from these annotations.

This is used to explain the QAvalidator Analysis DSL.

== Open Issues / Improvements

* The Groovy Compiler has a bug: It does not offer the JavaDoc comments to the annotation processor.
  That's the reason why we have descriptions of the commands and their parameters in annotations instead of using
  JavaDoc.
* The output path is hard-coded to `qav-doc/src-gen/generated-docs`;
  it would be nicer if it could be adjusted using a compiler option or so.

== Release Notes

=== 1.0.1 [work in progress]

* Only create the output directory when the first output is written.
  Avoids creating output directoris when no output is generated at all, e.g. in the Maven Plugin.


=== 1.0.0

* Released.
